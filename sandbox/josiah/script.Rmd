#### 1. Specify Causal Model representing real background knowledge

**Option 1: Complicated**

- Target: $Y$ = did the employee leave? (i.e., 1 or 0 in the data)
- Treatment: $A$ = salary (i.e., high/medium/low in the data)
- Endogenous nodes
$$\begin{aligned}
W_1& = satisfaction\_level\\
W_2& = last\_evaluation\\
W_3& = number\_project\\
W_4& = average\_monthly\_hours\\
W_5& = time\_spend\_company\\
W_6& = work\_accident\\
W_7& = promotion\_last\_5years\\
W_8& = sales
\end{aligned}$$

This gives us the following model


**Option 2: Simplified**

- Target: $Y$ = did the employee leave? (i.e., 1 or 0 in the data)
- Treatment: $A$ = salary (i.e., high/medium/low in the data)
- Endogenous nodes: $W = (W_1, W_2, W_3, W_4, W_5, W_6, W_7, W_8)$, where

$$\begin{aligned}W_1& = satisfaction\_level\\
W_2& = last\_evaluation\\
W_3& = number\_project\\
W_4& = average\_monthly\_hours\\
W_5& = time\_spend\_company\\
W_6& = work\_accident\\
W_7& = promotion\_last\_5years\\
W_8& = sales

\end{aligned}$$

- Background (exogenous) variables: $U = (U_{W}, U_A , U_Y ) \sim 
P_U$

- Structural equations F:

$$\begin{aligned} 
W&=f_{W}(U_{W}) \\ 
A&=f_{A}(W, U_A) \\ 
Y&=f_{Y}(W_1, W_2, A, U_Y) \end{aligned}$$

#### 2. Specify Causal Queston 

Does making more money make you less likely to leave your job? This is the causal question that defines the scope of this project. How much a company pays their employees is under teh coThis question is of interest because it is one thing that a company can control to some extent.

*Secondary question as time allows. Assuming the salary is associated with higher turnover.  Do people value money more than they think they do? i.e., are self-reported satisfaction levels indicative of whether an employee will leave?*

#### 3. Specify Observed Data and link to causal model 

#### 4. Identify : Knowledge + data sufficient? 

##### 5. Commit to an estmand as close to queston as possible, and a statistical model representing

#### 6. Estimate 

#### 7. Interpret Results
